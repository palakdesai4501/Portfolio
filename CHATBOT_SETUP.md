## API Usage Optimization

### Free Tier Limits

- **15 requests per minute**
- **1,500 requests per day**
- **1 million tokens per month**

### Cost Protection Features

- **Rate limiting**: 5 messages per IP per hour
- **Token optimization**: Limited conversation history (6 messages max)
- **Focused responses**: Short initial answers, detailed only when requested
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of quota exceeded

### Production Cost Considerations

- Each user message = 1 API request
- Popular portfolios may exceed free tier
- Monitor usage in Google AI Studio
- Consider upgrading if needed (very affordable)

### Real-World Usage Estimates

- **Small portfolio**: 10-50 visitors/day = FREE âœ…
- **Popular portfolio**: 100-200 visitors/day = Still likely FREE âœ…  
- **Viral portfolio**: 500+ visitors/day = May need paid plan (~$0.50/day) ðŸ’°

### Protection Safeguards

- **Rate limiting** prevents abuse (5 messages per visitor per hour)
- **Token optimization** reduces costs per request
- **Conversation limits** prevent runaway token usage
- **IP tracking** prevents spam and excessive usage

## Security

- API key is stored securely in environment variables
- No sensitive data exposed to client-side
- Conversation history is not stored server-side

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"API key not configured"**: Check your `.env.local` file
2. **No responses**: Verify your API key is valid
3. **Quota exceeded**: Check your API usage in Google AI Studio

### Testing

- Test with both on-topic and off-topic questions
- Verify theme switching works correctly
- Check mobile responsiveness

## Example Conversations

**Good Questions:**

- "What is Palak's background?"
- "Tell me about the GoTravel France project"
- "What technologies does Palak know?"
- "Where has Palak worked?"

**Redirected Questions:**

- "What's the weather?" â†’ "I can only answer questions about Palak..."
