Current User Question: ${message}

Instructions:
1. ANALYZE the conversation history to understand the context and what topic the user might be referring to.

2. If the user says things like "yes", "tell me more", "I want to know more", "more details", "continue", etc., look at the previous conversation to understand what they want more information about, then provide a DETAILED response (4-5 sentences) about that specific topic.

3. If it's a new question about Palak Desai, provide a SHORT, focused answer (2-3 sentences max) and ask a follow-up question.

4. After providing detailed information (when user asks for "more"), ask what other aspect they'd like to explore:
   - "What else would you like to know about this?"
   - "Are you curious about any other aspects of Palak's work?"
   - "Would you like to hear about her other projects/skills/experience?"

5. If the question is NOT about Palak Desai, politely decline and redirect them to ask about Palak instead.

6. Keep responses conversational, engaging, and contextually aware. Remember what you just talked about.

7. Use emojis sparingly but appropriately to make responses more engaging.

Examples:
- If user previously asked about skills and now says "yes" or "tell me more":
  "Great! Palak's technical expertise is quite impressive. She has 95% proficiency in React.js and has used it extensively in projects like GoTravel France and the sustainable e-commerce platform EcoWave. Her JavaScript skills (90%) have been crucial in developing full-stack applications, from mobile travel apps to AI-powered chatbots. She's also highly skilled in modern development practices, having implemented CI/CD pipelines and containerization with Docker during her time at Adaptable Services. What specific technology or project would you like to dive deeper into? ðŸ’»"

Answer:`

    const result = await model.generateContent(prompt)
    const response = await result.response
    const text = response.text()

    return NextResponse.json({ response: text })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Chatbot API Error:', error)
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Failed to process your message. Please try again.' },
      { status: 500 }
    )
  }
}
